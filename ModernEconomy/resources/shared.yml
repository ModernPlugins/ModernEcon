#### SYNCHRONIZED CONFIGURATION FILE
#### Settings in this file will be synchronized to all servers.
#### For changes here to take effect, shut down ALL servers in the network, wait for a few seconds, then start ONLY this server.
#### Only start other servers AFTER the "[ModernEconomy] Startup completed" message is displayed.
#### Synchronized configuration will always be overridden by the earliest-started server in the network after the last global shutdown (except for some very rare race conditions).

#### See https://modernplugins.github.io/ModernEconomy/users for explanation.
